<h1>
<font size=+3>The GeomEngine geometric engine</font></h1>

<p><br>The GeomEngine geometric engine (GeomEngine) is the constraint
engine for GUI primitives. GeomEngine is a value-oriented engine which
operates in a coordinate-dependent environment. It is also a real-time
engine. Unlike for instance GAE, GeomEngine must be able to update the
constraint values of the GUI depictors at a frame rate high enough to support
manipulatible diagrams.
<p>GeomEngine is designed for use with the G-2 Geometric Algebra, and provides
a fast interface for use by the GUI. It has also been specially designed
to work efficiently with DrawObj depictors. This means that the depictors
and the engine can be closely mated to each other, giving the GUI improved
performance in the fast rendering of manipulatible diagrams.
<p>GeomEngine uses ideas from several different disciplines: Geometric
Algebra, Compiler Theory, and Animation Software. The Compiler Theory emphasis
is perhaps the most important to understanding the engine's real-time architecture.
When given a new expression, GeomEngine compiles it into "stack code",
a series of abstract opcodes designed for a stack-machine Geometric Algebra
interpreter built into GeomEngine. The general philosophy is to perform
as much <i>a priori</i> computation as possible during this compilation
phase. Every computation that can be done when an expression is added or
deleted from the engine is one less computation that the engine will need
to perform when part of the manipulatible diagram which the engine constrains
is dragged on the screen. The parsing required to produce the aforementioned
"stack code" is performed by a LALR parser.
<p>GeomEngine also has an optimization system that is becoming increasingly
integrated into the regular operation of the engine.&nbsp; This optimization
system takes "stack code" and compiles it into bytecode, the machine language
of the Java Virtual Machine.&nbsp; This machine language version can then
be directly executed by the Java VM without the need for a Geometric Algebra
interpreter just like any other compiled code.&nbsp; When thinking about
the execution of this VM code keep in mind that modern Java VMs like HotSpot
perform BOTH Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation to native code, and method
inlining at runtime.&nbsp; The bytecode generated by the optimization system
can be directly converted to native machine code for the host CPU (e.g.
Intel Pentium) by the VM.&nbsp; Further, the VM can replace method calls
in the generated bytecode with inlined code.&nbsp; These capabilities work
together.&nbsp; For instance, the VM can inline method code and then JIT
compile the inlined code to Pentium instructions.&nbsp; As a result, code
generated by the optimization system has excellent performance.
<p>Certain architectural considerations tend to apply across compilers.
These considerations are laid out in texts such as "Compilers, principles,
techniques, and tools." by V. Aho, R. Sethi, and J. Ullman (C) 1988 Addison-Wesley.
GeomEngine adheres to the architectural principles found in this text.
In specific, source expressions in GeomEngine are first passed into a lexical
analyzer to generate a list of lexemes. Second, the lexemes are passed
to a parser which generates a parse tree corresponding to the expression.&nbsp;
The parse tree which leaves the parser is then passed to a code generator
class which traverses the parse tree to produce stack code (which is based
on postfix notation) for the expression. Finally, the stack code is passed
into a linker, which links the new stack code with existing pieces of stack
code, and determines an execution order.&nbsp; Optimization currently runs
separately from the main pipeline.
<p>Each time that a manipulatible diagram's position is dragged, control
passes to yet another module called the executor. The executor grabs each
piece of stack code in the execution order determined by the linker and
executes it. The executor is designed to have a few bottlenecks as possible.&nbsp;
The latest executor can either interpret "stack code" expressions, or directly
execute expressions processed into bytecode by the optimization system.
<h2>
GeomEngine Semantics</h2>

<h3>
Ports</h3>
This section describes GeomEngine's handling of ports. The definition and
use of the word "port" in this document is identical to that in the documentation
for DrawObj.
<p>GeomEngine stores a list of variables, and a list of assignment expressions.
Not every variable is assigned to by an expression, but every unique variable
referenced by some expression is stored in the list of variables. Each
item in the variable list has five parts: a variable name of type FlexString,
a value of type mvec, a set of flags indicating whether the variable is
bound by assignment, a domain (e.g. whether it is a vector, complex number,
etc.), and a I/O definition for the variable (which is used to support
minimization semantics for a future numerical solver). The combination
of these five items is called a port. Ports in GeomEngine may be created
or deleted as expressions in GeomEngine are created, deleted, or changed.
<p>One important design decision for GeomEngine is the is the determination
of how the GUI (including its various depictors) will access the ports
of the GeomEngine. One approach is to make the ports the sole property
of the GeomEngine. Outside classes would then get get a copy of the port
values only by querying the GeomEngine with the ID of a particular port.
Each query call would cause the engine to search through its variables
until it found the appropriate port. For smooth animation, the manipulatible
diagrams would have to be updated on the screen up to sixty times per second.
During each of these updates, the engine would need to process many searches--
possibly several per depictor.
<p>Although this approach would be the most appropriate one for other engines
of the MWS, the author has decided that the wasted search time associated
with the real-time operation of the engine would be excessive. Instead,
GeomEngine uses a shared-memory approach to ports. GeomEngine passes references
to its port items to the GUI, which in turn passes them to the ports of
the appropriate depictor(s). As a result, the depictor(s) and the GeomEngine
share the ports. When GeomEngine wishes to delete a port, it must notify
the GUI first. The GUI will then deal with the port on the appropriate
depictor(s).
<p>Because the depictor and the GeomEngine both share references to the
same current values, no searching is needed. The depictor always has direct
access to the world-coordinate values that it needs to update itself. When
the depictor is dragged, it can directly change the values being manipulated
on the screen without asking the GeomEngine to perform a search. As a result,
the shared memory architecture is very fast. The downside is that depictors
must be careful not to clobber the GeomEngine's memory. However, this is
an acceptable level of care to achieve fast rendering. It should be noted
that any unsafe behavior between the GE and the GUI does not affect the
safety of other portions of the MWS.
<h3>
Port Messages</h3>
There are multiple GeomEngine methods that can affect ports. Among them
are: ChangeExpression(), DeleteExpression(), and PopUndo(). DeleteExpression()
can only cause the deletion of ports (with the deletion of each related
variable), while ChangeExpression() or PopUndo() can cause either the creation
or deletion of ports (with the creation or deletion of each related variable).
On each creation or deletion, GeomEngine sends back a message containing
the port which was created or deleted. The methods to call on port creation
or deletion are passed as parameters to the methods that actually carry
out the port creation or deletion.&nbsp; Note: when PopUndo() re-creates
a deleted port the previous port value is not resurrected.&nbsp; Only the
port ID is re-created.&nbsp; This will be addressed in a future version
of the software.

<h1>
Current Limitations of the GeomEngine Geometric Engine</h1>
1. The current default solver linkage, BlueToh, can only backsolve
expressions of the form "a=b".  More sophisticated solving either
does not work well (e.g. SimplexSolverLinkage) or is not supported
at this time.
<p>2. Division by an idempotent multivector does not raise an exception.
Most numerical engines will report an error in this case.
<p>3. Constant propagation is not supported by the optimization system.
