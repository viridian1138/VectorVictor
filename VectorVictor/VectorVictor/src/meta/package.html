<H1>An Introduction to meta</H1>

	<P><H2>Part I - Introduction and Terminology</H2>

	<P>The meta package defines the fundamental data structures used in the project.
Many computer scientists consider the data structure, or DS, to be a fundamental part of
 software design.  One important notion associated with a DS is that it implements an abstract data 
type, or ADT.  That is to say the DS is a type which supports a well-defined set of operations, and that 
the internal structure of a DS can be changed without affecting programs which use it if appropriate 
changes are made to the implementation of these operations.

	<P>Similarly, it is accepted that there are a set of DSes that are independent of the type of 
data that they store.  For instance, one would expect a single linked-list implementation to be able to 
store a list of integers, a list of floating point numbers, or a list of records without modification or 
recompilation.  Further one should be able to generate lists of binary trees of some record type, or 
binary trees of lists of some record type, or lists of lists of some record type just by applying 
appropriate DS operations.  Variant data (such as the use of variant records) should be storable.  
This includes lists that store simple records in some nodes, and trees or queues in others.

	<P>Many current implementations of DSes have some or all of the above traits.  However, in many 
cases they require the programmer to write many of the low-level routines required to actually manipulate 
the data.  In particular, there is no standard way for an arbitrary DS to copy itself (and its data), or 
to delete itself (and its data).  In reality, there are an infinite number of ways that a particular DS 
might do this.  However, there are some that are much more "important" than others.  A good analogy to 
this is provided by the study of algorithms for binary tree traversals.  There are an infinite number of 
possible traversal algorithms (if we allow data-dependent traversals, and we say that the data can be of 
any type), but three of them are considered to be standard in CS.  These are the inorder traversal, the 
preorder traversal, and the postorder traversal.

	<P>The meta class is an evolving ad-hoc interface for supporting those DS copy and deletion 
operations which are "important" in a certain sense.  It is important to note that not every DS can 
support every "important" operation.  This is because there are fundamentally two types of ADTs.  There 
are those which support a concept of being "empty".  For instance, a queue or a stack is empty if it 
contains no elements.  However, a data type such as an integer can not be empty because that integer type 
will always contain an integer.  Thus we can not send a method asking that integer to delete its internal 
data, and leave only an "empty integer."  However, it is very important that we have an operation to 
empty a stack or a queue.

	<P>It is also important to note that such an operation may require what is called propagation.  
For instance to delete a binary tree of linked lists of trees of some tuple type X, we may need a 
deletion that for each binary tree node of the binary tree of linked lists of trees of X deletes the 
entire linked list of trees of X, and for each node of that linked list of trees of X deletes the entire 
tree of X.  Thus, the deletion operation must propagate from the binary tree to each linked list, and to 
each tree in each linked list, and to each X in each tree.  Since the binary tree does not internally 
know how to delete every arbitrary DS that could possibly exist, it must ask each DS (in this case each 
list) to delete itself using the meta interface.  And each list must ask each tree to delete itself.  And 
each tree must ask each X to delete itself.  Sometimes one does not want propagation.  For instance, the 
lists in this example may in fact be shared by several DSes.  In this case, it may not be appropriate 
for the binary tree deletion to also delete the linked lists.  One needs to be able to modify how each DS 
propagates.  Propagation is further covered in Part III.

	<P>In meta terminology, a DS that supports a concept of emptiness is called a high-level DS.  
A DS that does not support this concept is called a low-level DS.  Further, it is specified that a 
high-level DS must support all appropriate operations when empty.  This additional constraint has a 
number of ramifications.  For instance a node from a linked list (or a reference directly to such a node) 
can not be used as a high-level DS because if such a DS were empty (i.e. there's a non-existent node or 
NULL reference), one could not call an inquiry function to determine if the DS is in fact empty.  The 
operation ((List)NULL)->Empty() isn't allowed in Java (because a method must be executed 
on a valid object).  Therefore, such a DS is low-level.  Creating a class which contains such a 
low-level reference as an attribute allows a high-level linked-list DS to be created.

	<P>There are many ways to delete a high-level structure such as a queue which may be applicable 
in different situations.  One might want to execute an operation which deletes both the queue, and the 
data which it contains.  As mentioned before, one might only want to delete the internal data and thus 
leave an empty queue.  There are also situations where one wants to delete a high level DS, but not the 
information it contains.  This is especially true when one is manipulating shared lists.  There are a 
similar variety of operations for copying a high-level DS.

	<P>Of these copy and delete operations, only the ones that operate both on the DS and its 
nternal data can usually be applied to low-level DSes.  There are some exceptions.  For instance, one 
can legally copy all the internal data from one tuple into another type-identical tuple.  Generally, 
though, the operations which apply to an arbitrary data structure can be partitioned into high-level 
operations (which act on the data inside a structure), and low-level operations which act upon a 
structure.  In the meta interface, methods which are high-level contain the suffix "Info" in their 
names.  Those that are low-level do not.  The set of high-level operations is not inclusive in that 
there are some low-level operations which properly apply only to high-level DSes.

	<P>All high-level copy operations have a different syntax than their low-level counterparts.  
This is because a copy of internal information between two high-level DSes requires information about 
the location of the destination DS.  This information is passed in the parameter of such a method.  
Low-level copy operations do not require, and do not use, a destination DS because they by nature create 
new DSes.  In order to have a base class that applies symmetrically to all DSes, a reference to meta is 
passed in all high-level copies.  However, both the source and destination DSes must be type-identical.  
Further, it is useful to have the method generate an error message if the source and destination types 
are not identical.  As a practical matter, this requires meta to be equipped with a method for the 
support type inferencing.  In Java, this capability is provided by the language through the <code>instanceof</code>
operator and the cast operator.

	<P>Earlier meta implementations in C++ contained a "safety" #define that controlled the level
of type-checking that meta used in its equivalent to the "cast" operator.  This allowed type-checking to
be turned on in the "test" phase (to keep early bugs from core-dumping the program), and then turned off in the
"production" phase (to maximize execution phase).  In its current incarnation, the Java VM always type-checks its
casts.  It is believed that future Java compilers will allow a way to turn off this type checking when executing
"production" code.  This will increase the execution speed of meta-based programs.

	<P>Certain run-time checks required by "robust" applications 
will be supported at both safety levels as meta evolves to take full advantage of Java.  Foremost among these 
is the handling of out-of-memory situations.  A standard mechanism which will "roll back" any meta 
copy operation which generates an out-of-memory exception is planned.  Such a mechanism will be 
non-trivial because it must properly handle propagation.

	<P><H2>Part III - Details of DS implementation.</H2>

	<P>Copying and deleting a sophisticated meta-compliant structure (a list, tree, 
stack, queue, etc.) in a proper way requires high flexibility.  The data in a structure 
may vary in type from node to node, requiring a different copy or deletion operation for 
each data type.  The copy or deletion may need to propagate.  Meta uses a single, elegant 
scheme to handle both of these problems.

	<P>In a meta structure such as a list, the nodes of a list can be of one of two 
types.  The first is a standard node type.  The standard node (in addition to references 
to other nodes) contains a reference of type meta, a CopyMode, and an EraseMode.  
The meta reference holds the data that is "contained" in that node.  All three fields 
can accessed and modified by the programmer.  When a node needs to be erased, the 
EraseMode for that node is called upon the data field by switching on an integer value.  
This "erases" the data in some way chosen by the programmer.  
After this erasure is complete, the node itself is deleted.

	<P>When a standard node is copied, a somewhat reverse operation occurs.  First, a 
new node is created.  Second, the CopyMode of the original node is applied to the original 
data, returning a "copy" of that data.  That copy is placed in the data field of the new node.  
Finally, the CopyMode and EraseMode of the original code are copied to the new node.  Thus, 
the new node can copy and erase itself in the same way as the original node.

	<P>The other type of node is an alternate node, or alt-node.  An alt-node is created 
using a template, and incorporated some other meta-compliant class directly into a record of 
that node (assuming that the Java VM will inline data associated with a member declared "final").  
This can reduce the tangle of references required to implement some data structures, 
and often results in better memory management.  A complete treatment of alt-nodes is beyond the 
scope of this paper.  In addition to some class, 
an alt-node contains an EraseMode and a CopyInfoMode.  Alt-nodes are erased in an identical manner 
to standard nodes.  However alt-nodes tend to require high-level, as opposed to low-level, erasures.  
Because the alt-node's data exists inside the node, it is not appropriate to set an EraseMode for 
an outright deletion.  Copy operations for alt-nodes are also similar to those for standard nodes, 
except that a high-level copy operation is performed.  

	<P>Because the use of CopyModes, CopyInfoModes, and EraseModes give each node specific 
instructions on how to "erase itself," propagation can be finely controlled.  Sometimes, 
especially where data structures are shared, propagation needs to be completely turned off.  
Operations like eraseDataInfo(), wake(), copyDataInfo(), copyDoNothing(), and 
copyReturnNull() can be used as modes for this purpose.  At other times, one requires full 
propagation throughout a DS.  One can use copyAll() and copyAllInfo() as modes to provide this 
functionality.  Other operations fall in between, and fill specific roles for certain applications.

	<P>Although this concept of using these modes can be explained simply, they can be used 
in a tremendously complicated number of ways.  Usually, the type of data one wants to implement will 
point to the appropriate modes.
