/**
 * The LowLevelType class supplies code for creating linked low level structures to be
 * used in high level structures.  As
 * <A HREF="package.html">An Introduction to Meta</A> states, there are two types of data
 * structures: high level and low level.  The difference is that low level structures do not
 * have a concept of "empty".  One reason why low level structures are needed is to represent
 * the nodes contained in high level structures.  LowLevelType is an abstract class which contains
 * important "glue" code for implementing such nodes.  It is not intended for other kinds of low
 * level data structures.  LowLevelType can be used to support both standard and alt-nodes.<P>
 *
 * Two important classes that use LowLevelType are {@link LowLevelList} and {@link LowLevelBinTree}.
