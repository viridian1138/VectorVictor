<P>The MathImage package provides equation rendering capabilities.
MathImage can either be run standalone as its own component
(MathImageApp) or as a rendering class used by other applications
(MathImage).  In addition to being useful as an equation editor,
MathImageApp also serves as a test driver for MathImage.
<BR>
<P>The MathImage system is based on standard LALR.  Lexical analysis
and parsing are provided by SLexAnal and SEparser classes respectively.
The design follows many of the conventions in the book "Compilers" by
Alfred V. Aho, Ravi Sethi, and Jeffrey D. Ullman, (C) 1988
Addison-Wesley.
